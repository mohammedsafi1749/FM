EXP NO : 4 GENERATION AND DETECTION OF FM

AIM:

To write a program for Frequency Modulation and Demodulation using SCILAB and to observe
and measure the frequency deviation and the modulation index of FM.

EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED

 Computer with i3 Processor

 SCI LAB

THEORY:

Frequency modulation is a type of modulation in which the frequency of the high frequency
(carrier) is varied in accordance with the instantaneous value of the modulating signal.
FREQUENCY DEVIATION f and MODULATION INDEX m f :
The frequency deviation f represents the maximum shift between the modulatedsignal
frequency, over and under the frequency of the carrier
